    description: "From a young age, Seratonin was drawn to the quiet corners of nature, where the sunlight filtered softly through leaves and the wind carried gentle whispers. Even as a child, she felt the emotions of those around her deeply, laughing when friends laughed and crying when they cried. She would often sit for hours under trees, listening to the rustle of leaves as if they spoke back to her. Her leaf-controlling powers first appeared in small, playful ways. A leaf would twirl to catch her attention, or a gentle breeze would follow her footsteps. Loved and cherished by those who knew her sensitivity, Seratonin grew up learning to balance her empathetic heart with mindfulness, finding comfort in meditation, quiet walks, and the small wonders of the natural world. Even then, she was already a little beacon of warmth and calm, ready to lift others’ spirits with a kind word, a laugh, or the soft dance of leaves around her.",

    description: "Endorphin is the quiet protector, Ever since childhood, he’s been the one to step forward when others hesitate, shielding his friends from harm without a second thought. Though often aloof and reserved, his actions speak louder than words steady, dependable, and strong when it counts. He hides his own pain behind an easy smile, brushing off wounds with a casual “I’m fine” as long as everyone else is safe. Beneath his cool, laid-back demeanor lies a heart driven by loyalty and quiet courage. Endorphin is the embodiment of resilience and comfort, the one who absorbs the hurt so others can heal, the silent strength that reminds everyone they’re not alone.",

    description: "Dopamine once was a fragile boy, curious, idealistic, and easily swayed by the highs and lows of life. He longed for validation and dreamed of success, believing that independence and achievement were the only paths to strength. After promising never to rely on anyone again, he distanced himself from those who cared for him, focusing solely on building his own future. Yet beneath that determined exterior still beats a heart that remembers warmth, connection, and purpose. Through knowledge and relentless drive, he rose to become one of the most successful and influential individuals of his time. But behind his sharp mind and poised confidence lies the quiet question that defines him: What are you willing to stake? To Dopamine, success means more than power it is a test of heart, balance, and the courage to rediscover what truly matters.",

    description: "Oxytocin has always been guided by love the most tender and powerful force within her. As a child, she formed bonds easily, her heart wide open and trusting. But that openness often left her hurt, as others took advantage of her kindness and attachment. Over time, she learned to build walls, not out of coldness, but out of self-preservation. Many misunderstood her distance, calling her a “man-hater,” never seeing the scars beneath her calm smile. Now known for her advocacies and inspirational life, Oxytocin has transformed her pain into purpose. She uses her voice to uplift others, to remind them that love is not blind devotion, but mindful care for oneself and for others. Yet, even after being broken, Oxytocin never stopped believing in the goodness within people. She continues to offer compassion, giving others a chance to change, to heal, and to be better. Her love is patient, her forgiveness quiet yet enduring. Among all forms of motivation, she embodies the truth she lives by: love undoubtedly shines the brightest.",

Even as a child, her intellect shone brightly; she questioned systems far beyond her years, her curiosity and insight catching the attention of nobles and scholars who recognized her brilliance. With their support, she pursued her studies with relentless dedication, eventually earning her place as a respected scholar and diplomat committed to maintaining peace and justice. Though she carries herself with composure and wisdom, her heart remembers the pain of struggle, driving her to fight for those who cannot speak for themselves. Nora’s calm, analytical nature allows her to navigate political storms with grace, always balancing compassion with reason. Yet behind her disciplined facade lies a quiet longing to escape the weight of duty, to breathe freely beneath open skies, and to remember the simple joys of living beyond the boundaries of responsibility.",

    description: "Descended from the ancient people of the lost ruins, Glutamate is a being of overwhelming strength and hunger, born into a modern world that can barely contain him. In his early years, he wandered like a nomad, living off instinct devouring whatever he could find, fighting anyone who dared challenge him, yet never feeling truly satisfied. His insatiable appetite for food and battle became both his curse and his identity, earning him a fearsome reputation. Everything changed when he crossed paths with the monks of the Center, who saw through his wildness and taught him the art of temperance. Through years of discipline, Glutamate learned to restrain his immense power and to channel his cravings into focus and balance. Now, though he still jokes with friends about eating 500 kilos of food or sparring with robots for fun, behind his hearty laugh lies a man who has conquered himself a living embodiment of self-control born from chaos, proving that true strength is not in indulgence, but in mastery.",

    description: "Born into a noble family of scholars, Acetylcholine had everything the world could offer wealth, prestige, and access to the greatest libraries of knowledge. Yet despite her privilege, she often found herself restless and unsatisfied, yearning not for comfort but for deeper understanding. Unlike her lineage, untouched by magic, she sought to uncover the secrets of existence through pure intellect and curiosity alone. Her tireless pursuit led her to defy the regular order of the world decoding the configuration of particles, bending matter, and even learning to harness the subtle pull of the universe itself. Still, she never aligned herself with notions of good or evil; her devotion lay only in the pursuit of truth and comprehension. To her, learning was both play and purpose, a dance between logic and wonder. Though she often isolates herself to study, those who know her understand that her wisdom keeps the balance among her more impulsive friends guiding, observing, and ensuring that their chaos never overwhelms the harmony of their shared world.",

    description: "Born into a family once bound to servitude, Adrenaline grew up at the margins of nobility mocked for his background, ridiculed for his trembling hands, and dismissed as nothing more than a coward. From childhood, his life was a constant battle between fight and flight, and for years, flight was all he knew. Yet every time he ran, a voice in him whispered that one day he would stand and fight back. That day came, and when it did, he never stopped running toward danger again. What began as fear transformed into obsession; the rush that once paralyzed him became his reason to live. Adrenaline turned his body into his own experiment, mastering the edge between life and death through bioengineering, genetics, and raw willpower. They call him reckless, even insane, but in truth, he simply refuses to live half-alive. He embodies the pulse of chaos itself an untamed spirit chasing the thrill of existence, proving that courage isn’t the absence of fear but the mastery of it.",

Born deep within a lush rainforest, far from civilization, his childhood was shaped by the harmony of life and growth that surrounded him. His fascination with the natural world grew from watching plants thrive, and he often said that humans and plants were not so different, both needing nourishment to evolve, whether through nutrients or knowledge. But his tranquil world shattered the day he left home in search of medicine for his ailing grandfather. Raiders attacked their home, and in his absence, his grandfather was slain defending Chiyaki’s sister and the ancient artifact their family had protected for generations. Wracked with grief yet fueled by purpose, Chiyaki and his sister now wander from place to place, seeking the stolen relic and the truths hidden within it. His journey is not just about reclaiming what was lost but understanding the mysteries of existence itself, a quest to bridge the gap between nature, knowledge, and the unseen threads that bind all life.",

Abandoned since birth, with no memory of his parents, he grew up among criminals and scavengers, learning early that deception and cunning were his only means to endure. He became a master of adaptation, able to outwit those around him and blend into any environment, surviving by reading people as easily as others read books. Yet beneath his cold exterior lies a quiet longing for peace, a fragile dream that refuses to die. He often imagines a life where he could wake without fear or the need for manipulation, where trust and calm are more than fantasies. Despite being shaped by chaos, Null still seeks the impossible serenity he’s never known. Now he drifts from place to place, chasing whispers of the mythical “Fruit of Peace,” said to appear only under gruesome conditions. Whether this quest will save or consume him remains uncertain, but for Null, even a glimpse of peace is worth any peril.",
